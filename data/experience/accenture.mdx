▪ I worked in a sixteen-member team to migrate the data of fourteen Singapore agencies from their legacy IT systems to a new whole-of-government IT system

▪ I extracted data via SFTP, transformed data with Excel and CloverDX, and loaded production data into the new IT system. I also programmed several enhancements to this data pipeline

▪ I liaised with the various government agency stakeholders to address their issues and to maintain an up-to-date status dashboard for Accenture leadership

▪ I was also at Accenture from Nov 2021 to Dec 2021 as part of this internship
