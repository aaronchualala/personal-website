This is a largely exhaustive list of the various activities I was involved in that roughly follows the chronological development of my interests. While varied, my central theme was (and still is) finding impactful areas to work on. 

I was first drawn to religious systems because of their clarity of direction, then later shifted to biology for its greater scientific rigour, and transitioned to the humanities and social sciences where more tangible developments in human society seemed to occur.  

Nevertheless, these scholarly pursuits were still rather removed from everyday reality. Did a fair bit of volunteering, always with a different demographic, to appreciate individual lived experiences. I contrasted this with public policy activities which offered a contrasting top-down sort of view.

Eventually grew skeptical of the epistemological foundations of the social sciences and disillusioned by the politicking of policy. These seem to limit their impact, yet were inescapable (and necessary) parts of these disciplines.

Ventured into business in my last year of pre-university education, which still remains a strong interest. Because at its core, business involves finding the best way to provide value to the world, i.e. â€” impact.
