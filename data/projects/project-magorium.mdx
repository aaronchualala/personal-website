<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    I worked in a team to develop a <a href="https://master--elated-ride-639e34.netlify.app/projects">web portal</a> for a Greentech startup to support their corporate social responsibility efforts
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    Magorium, a greentech company, has a community and social impact branch to promote their CSR efforts. 
    This includes collaboration with schools, companies and the community to promote sustainability, in terms of education and projects. 
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    However, they lacked a centralised website to display all these information, and a call-to-action platform for people to join their initiatives.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ A one-stop eco-website for sustainability information and Magorium’s CSR efforts.
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Designed the "Projects" page with Figma <br/>
    ▪ Programmed the "Blog" page with ReactJS and Gatsby<br/>
    ▪ Setted up Contentful CMS
