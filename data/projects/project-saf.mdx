<h4>Reflections</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Software Engineering — functional and solved a commonly-faced issue but the code architecture, and time and space complexity of the code was, well, not great. I spent most of my pre-university time on humanities-related extracurriculars and I had no such computational concepts at that time haha. But I look back on this project with great fondness because it was one of my first and I went pretty far with it
    ▪ Military culture — approval was really, really slow. I took probably four months to figure out the core of what to build, how to build it and actually building it, but the approval of my final product took many twists and turns and more than six months.
