<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    Independently programmed an Excel-based desktop application for inventory management, successfully pitched it to senior staff officers (Colonel-level) at three conferences (battalion-, division-, and army- level), and subsequently maintained the application in production. Eventually taught and passed it on to my understudy.
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ To maintain the security of army camps in Singapore, full-time National Serviceman (NSFs) perform guard duties such as patrol fences, monitoring cameras, protecting turnstiles etc. These  duties require equipment such as rifles, walkie-talkies and batons. At the start and end of each shift, NSFs check out and check in the necessary equipment in the presence of the guardroom commander. 
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ The checking out and in of equipment was recorded on a pen-and-paper notebook. This gave rise to three problems: (1) single point of failure if the notebook was destroyed or damaged, (2) very high number of human errors due to freeform nature of writing, and (3) wasted time as many columns contained the same data.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ A digital application that (a) archived and backed-up data, (b) had dropdown boxes with fixed values and (c) code to autofill predictable values (dates, names, items, quantities).
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ ActiveX Controls on the frontend and Visual Basic for Applications on the backend.
    ▪ Incorporated peripheral devices: barcode scanner to scan identification cards (instead of manually typing in) and writing pad (for signatures).
    ▪ Added basic security features like sheet protection, NRIC-masking, hidden data sheets.
    ▪ Added password authentication to distinguish between different users roles: application owner, guardroom commander, guardroom operator. 
    ▪ Beta-tested application and iterated based on user feedback.
    ▪ Assisted divisional G2 officer in writing up a security report on the application.
    ▪ Created the presentation materials with feedback from superior officers. 
    ▪ Did the entire pitch of the problem, project and business value to various colonel-ranked officers at three conferences.
    </div>
    
<h4>Reflections</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Software Engineering — software was functional and solved a commonly-faced issue. However, with the knowledge I now have from university, I realise the code architecture, and time and space complexity of the code was quite poor. Overall, I still look back on this project with great fondness because it was my first big coding project and I'm proud of how far I went despite how little I knew then.<br/>
    ▪ Military culture — approval was really, really slow. I took probably four months to figure out the core of what to build, how to build it and actually building it, but the approval of my final product took many twists and turns and another six months.
