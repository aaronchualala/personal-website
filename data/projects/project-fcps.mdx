<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    I worked in a team to develop a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keep-fit-challenge-tasks/id1620492559">mobile app</a> which promotes healthy living habits among primary school students</div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    The Physical Education (P.E.) department at Fuchun Primary School had initiated a habit-tracking program 
    for their 600+ Primary 1 – 6 students, to encourage the students to adopt healthy living habits.
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div >
    Students were given a physical card and checked off boxes after completing a habit. 
    However, recording with pen-and-paper was troublesome for students and difficult for P.E. Teachers to analyse.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Build a mobile app for the students that adheres to the pre-existing design of the habit-tracker cards while allowing easy access to the cards from anywhere, anytime<br/>
    ▪ Build a website for the P.E. teachers that collates individual student records and enables faster querying and analysis of the data
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Programmed an app-wide multi-step Modal and added Redux in React Native for the mobile app <br/>
    ▪ Familiarised with backend (Firebase) and website codebase (Nextjs) to take over maintenance
    </div>
    
<h4>Reflections</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Lack of beneficiary interaction — I mostly programmed and only met with the P.E. teachers, but had no opportunity to do so with the end-beneficiaries, the students. Seeing their feedback and usage would have been a lot more fun, like my pre-university volunteering activities had been. I'd try to have more exposure to that in future projects.
