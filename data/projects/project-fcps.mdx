<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    Assisted in developing a mobile app (
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keepfitmobile">android</a>; <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keep-fit-challenge-tasks/id1620492559">iOS</a>
    ) to promote healthy living habits among primary school students
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    The Physical Education (P.E.) department at Fuchun Primary School had initiated a habit-tracking program 
    for their 600 Primary 1 – 6 students, to encourage the students to adopt healthy living habits.
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div >
    Students were given a physical card and checked off boxes after completing a habit. 
    However, recording with pen-and-paper was troublesome for students and difficult for P.E. Teachers to analyse.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Build a mobile app for the students that adheres to the pre-existing design of the habit-tracker cards while allowing easy access to the cards from anywhere, anytime<br/>
    ▪ Build a website for the P.E. teachers that collates individual student records and enables faster querying and analysis of the data
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Programmed an app-wide multi-step Modal and added Redux in React Native for the mobile app <br/>
    ▪ Familiarised with backend (Firebase) and website codebase (Nextjs) to take over maintenance
