<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    I built this personal website to showcase my personal portfolio!
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    I am seeking a Software Engineer Internship for Summer 2023 and sought a good way to showcase my experiences, projects and skills.
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    Current platforms are not adequate due to the variedness of my experiences and projects.
    For GitHub, I am unable to make much of my code available as many projects have been for external organisations. 
    For LinkedIn, its linear style makes presentation of my expertise, which intermixes and crosses between 
    various fields of both computing and business, difficult.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ A richly interlinked personal website where site visitors can easily see my Experiences, Projects I did in each role, and what Skills were used
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Built with Gatsby and hosted with Netlify <br/>
    ▪ The primary unique feature, which I have not seen in any other personal websites, is the strong linking between Experiences -> Projects -> Skills that helps me encapsulate my diverse skillset satisfyingly in a way other platforms cannot.
