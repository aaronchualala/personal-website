<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    Built this personal website to showcase my Portfolio!
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    I am seeking a Software Engineer Internship for Summer 2023 and was looking for the best way to showcase myself
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    Current platforms are not adequate due to the variedness of my experiences and projects.
    For GitHub, I am unable to make most of my code available as most of my code has been for external organisations. 
    For LinkedIn, its linear style makes presentation of my expertise, which intermixes and crosses between 
    various fields of both computing and business, difficult.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ A richly interlinked personal website where site visitors can easily see my Experiences, Projects I did in each role, and what Skills were used
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Built with Gatsby and hosted with Netlify
    </div>
    
<h4>Reflections</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Be uniquely me! The primary feature of my website, which I have not seen in any other personal websites, 
    is the neat linking between Experiences -> Projects -> Skills that helps me encapsulate my diverse skillset 
    satisfyingly in a way other platforms cannot.
