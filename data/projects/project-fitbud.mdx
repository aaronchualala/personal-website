<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    I was the technical lead for an academic Computer Science module ("SC2006 Software Engineering").
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    All physically eligble Singapore males under the age of forty have to take their annual Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) as part of their National Service
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    Lack of a training plan, exercise form correction, fellow test-takers to train with and the ability to track one's progress discourages Singapore males for training as well as they potentially could.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    A mobile application to help Singaporean National Servicemen train for their Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) with four main features: <br/>
        1. Registration and Login - create an account with us so we can understand your personal fitness abilities and targets (Fitbuds API, Strava API)  <br/>
        2. Training Plan — receive a customised workout daily based on your current fitness abilities, target fitness abilities and days left to your next IPPT (Fitbuds API)  <br/>
        3. Social Workouts — message and meet up with nearby users that have similar current fitness abilities (Fitbuds API, Google Map API) <br/>
        4. Pose Detector — get realtime feedback on your exercise posture when doing your Pushups and Situps (Tensorflowjs PoseNet model) <br/>
    </div>
