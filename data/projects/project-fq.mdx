<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    Developed a novel automated decision-making algorithm for qualitative market research
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    For the research division of Finquest
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<h4>Solution</h4>

    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Algorithm crawls and scrapes web data of potential target companies and 
    classifies them into Good Fits, Unsures and Rejects based on simple text classification <br></br>
    ▪ Blind-backtested the algorithm with my manager on three dissimilar projects (geographies, verticals, sectors etc.) 
    and demonstrated an average of 91% accuracy with time-savings of 40 man-hours per project<br/>
    ▪ Pitched the project and findings to the CEO and CTO, and passed the project to the Head of Data and AI when I left. 
    My project was considered promising, but accuracy was still too low compared to human judgement to make overall business sense for live usage
