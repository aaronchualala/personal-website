<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    I developed a novel automated decision-making algorithm for qualitative market research
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    I was interning in a purely business non-technical role as a analyst in the research division of Finquest. We worked in teams of 3–5 for durations of approximately 3 weeks.
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    As (senior) research analysts (interns), we combed through the website of each potential target company to determine if the company was a suitable fit for our client. While this required some nuance and business judgement calls, many of these were relatively straightforward calls to make and yet these straightforward calls were occuping a significant amount of our time and manpower.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Automate the decision-making process for the straightforward cases and flag out the complex cases for us analysts to study in closer detail, thus maximising the use of our time and enabling us to get through more target companies in the same periods of time
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ An algorithm crawls and scrapes web data of potential target companies and 
    classifies them into Good Fits, Unsures and Rejects based on simple text classification <br/>
    ▪ Blind-backtested the algorithm with my manager on three dissimilar projects (i.e. different geographies, verticals, sectors etc.) and demonstrated an average of 91% accuracy with time-savings of 40 man-hours per project<br/>
    ▪ Pitched the project and findings to the CEO and CTO, and passed the project to the Head of Data and AI when I left. My project was considered promising, but accuracy was still too low (only 91%) compared to human judgement to make overall business sense for live usage yet
    </div>
    
<h4>Reflections</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Failures — I was fairly disappointed that my project didn't get deployed. Invested a significant amount of my free time, but I definitely appreciated the business reasoning that went into eventually rejecting it. This was more of a case of running out of time to further improve and having to leave for my next internship, rather than my engineering failure. 
    ▪ Internationalism - I worked directly with British, Canadian, Chinese, Indian and Korean colleagues (on one project I was the only Singaporean); all three co-founders themselves were non-Singaporeans and spread out across the three offices of Singapore, London and Hong Kong; the projects were all transnational in nature. I like to believe that some of this cosmopolitan outlook rubbed onto me even after I left.
    ▪ Start-up culture — company was in a scaling up phase and I got to contribute to values/vision-setting activities and witness the firm hiring and growing tremendously during my time there. Overall, it was a wonderfully interesting place to get inducted into working culture.
