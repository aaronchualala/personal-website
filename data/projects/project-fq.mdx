<h4>Summary</h4>
I initiated and led the development of a novel automated decision-making algorithm for the research division of Finquest
using UiPath Robotic Enterprise Framework and Javascript

<h4>Description</h4>
▪ The algorithm crawls and scrapes web data of potential target companies and 
classifies them into Good Fits, Unsures and Rejects based on simple text classification <br></br>
▪ I blind-backtested the algorithm with my manager on three dissimilar projects (geographies, verticals, sectors etc.) 
and demonstrated an average of <b>91% accuracy with time-savings of 40 man-hours per project</b><br></br>
▪ I pitched the project and findings to the CEO and CTO, and passed the project to the Head of Data and AI when I left. 
My project was considered promising, but accuracy was still too low compared to human judgement to
make overall business sense for live usage

<h4>Footnotes</h4>
I completed the UiPath RPA Developer Certification
