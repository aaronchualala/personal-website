<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    I led the revamping of a public-facing Wordpress website to boost user engagement
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    The organisation, a 80G accredited organization operating nationwide in India, had plans to further expand their operations. 
    I was engaged to assist in this expansion as a pro-bono Associate Consultant at <a href="https://180dc.org">180 Degrees Consulting</a>.
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    The organisation founders' plans for further expansion required increased public awareness and spending. 
    However, they lacked the technical know-how to create a more appealing website and had insufficient revenue to finance the planned expansion.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Conduct comparative analysis of website features from top Indian non-profits to identify best user interface and user experience practices <br/>
    ▪ Conduct comparative analysis of fundraising methods used by other Indian Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and tailored recommendations for fundraising based on the organisation's specific situation
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Used Wordpress internal tools to add Media Carousel, Cards, improved colour theme and other analysis findings into the organisation's website<br/>
    ▪ Used market research to identify promising fundraising avenues based on similar NGOs who had successfully fundraised via these avenues
    </div>
    
<h4>Reflections</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Technical acumen — force multiplier for business expertise (and vice versa). As part of my involvement with 180DC, I trained on consulting tools like McKinsey’s 7-Steps Framework, Issue Trees and Prioritisation Matrices. With my previous technical experience. I was able to more intuitively know whether certain business ideas for the website were technically impossible/difficult to implement and share these opinions with my team mates. This led to faster iterations.<br/>
    ▪ Diversity — impedes processes but leads to more resilient outcomes. 
    Three of the five members in my team were non-Singaporeans, with all five from different academic backgrounds. This made for lively discussions and diversity of perspectives. A con was slower communication when having to explain ideas seemingly obvious to those in one's field but less appreciable to those outside. However, a pro was discussions that factored in a greater range of perspectives and therefore created more optimal solution (e.g. a team member from India had an aunt had previously founded a NGO in India allowing us to have a strong practical understanding of the fundraising situation in India).
