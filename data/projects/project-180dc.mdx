<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    Led the revamping of a public-facing Wordpress website to boost user engagement
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    The organisation, a 80G accredited organization operating nationwide in India, had plans to further expand their operations. 
    I was engaged to assist in this expansion as a pro-bono Associate Consultant at <a href="https://180dc.org">180 Degrees Consulting</a>.
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    Expansion required increased public awareness and spending. 
    However, the organisation's founders lacked the technical know-how to create a more appealing website and had insufficient revenue to finance the expansion.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Conduct comparative analysis of website features from top Indian non-profits to identify best user interface and user experience practices <br/>
    ▪ Conduct comparative analysis of fundraising methods used by other Indian Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and tailored recommendations for fundraising based on the organisation's specific situation
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Used Wordpress internal tools to add Media Carousel, Cards, improved colour theme and other analysis findings into the organisation's website<br/>
    ▪ Used market research to identify promising fundraising avenues based on similar NGOs who had successfully fundraised via these avenues
    </div>
    
<h4>Reflections</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Technical acumen is a force multiplier for business expertise (and vice versa). As part of my involvement with 180DC, I 
    trained on consulting tools like McKinsey’s 7-Steps Framework, Issue Trees and Prioritisation Matrices. But what
    made me a particularly good fit for this project was my previous technical experience. I was able to more intuitively know whether certain 
    business ideas for the website were technically impossible/difficult to implement and share these opinions with my team. This led to faster iterations.<br/>
    ▪ Diversity slows processes but builds resilient outcomes. 
    Three of the five members in my team were non-Singaporeans, with all five from different academic backgrounds. 
    This made for lively discussions and diversity of perspectives.
    The con was slower communication when having to explain ideas seemingly obvious to those in one's field but less appreciable to those outside the field.
    The pro was discussions that factored in a greater range of perspectives and therefore created more optimal solution. The clearest example of this was
    having a team member from India whose aunt had previously founded a NGO in India. Her contribution to our 
    practical understanding of the fundraising situation in India would not have been matched by a team of pure Singaporeans.
