<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    I built a web application that was a simple prototype of a Zoom-GoogleDoc-Telegram-BlackboardLearn superapp
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    Two NTU lecturers (one of whom I acquainted with when I took her course) identified a potential market opportunity for a new pedagogical tool to better support the educational needs of university students. They had gotten administrative approval from a NTU Education IT System Head to trial the platform they envisioned in NTU and also gotten financial backing from an external investor.
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    To develop a minimum viable product, trial and iterate on it in NTU, deploy it to serve NTU students and license to other educational institutions
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Requirements elicitation and analysis <br/>
    ▪ Research on the most suitable tech stack given the product business requirements <br/>
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Proposed AWS Chime as the best option due to its comprehensiveness of features, scalability, and reliability<br/>
    ▪ Built a working prototype with AWS Chime SDK (React library) — the image above is us having one of our meetings on it <br/>
    ▪ Implemented the learning platform's core features of (1) shared documents (left of above image), (2) video conferencing (centre-right) and (3) group chat (right). 
    </div>
    
<h4>Reflections</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Personal Career Direction — the disruptive ability of start-ups is exciting and this aspect is frequently emphasised in popular media, but being in such an early start-up with no real product-market fit was fairly anxiety-inducing for me because of the high uncertainty. The positives of startups do not outweigh these negatives for me at this point in time <br/>
    ▪ Mental Models for Assessing Ideas — in hindsight, I think the team's idea was flawed. Each of the products we were trying to incorporate have their own niches. Our idea didn't have any original feature but was merely bundling them all together. In the end, I reasoned that this bundling would create more negatives than positives for the user, or would at best be an incremental improvement. Finding mental models that help separate good from bad entrepreneurial ideas is something I still need to work on further.
