<h4>Summary</h4>
I explored the possibility of co-founding an EdTech startup (as a technical 
co-founder) with two NTU lecturers, a NUS administrator and an external financier

<h4>Description</h4>
▪ I researched potential tech stacks that could meet the product’s business requirements and proposed AWS
Chime as the best option due to its comprehensiveness of features, scalability, and reliability<br/>
▪ I built a simple prototype as a technical proof-of-concept of the product features envisioned. 
The image above is us having one of our meetings on the prototype<br/>
▪ The main features are video conferencing, chat and in-window shared document editing<br/>
