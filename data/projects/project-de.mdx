<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    Built a simple web application as a technical proof-of-concept to assess the feasibility of co-founding an EdTech startup
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    A team consisting of two NTU lecturers, a NTU Education IT System Manager and an external financier had determined
    based on their personal experience, academic research and market research, that there was 
    a need for a new pedagogical tool to better support the educational needs of university students. They 
    were looking for technical co-founder(s), specifically NTU students, to realise a minimum viable product 
    and to subsequently help lead development.
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    To develop a minimum viable product, trial and iterate on it in NTU, deploy it to serve NTU students and license to other educational institutions.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Research on the most suitable tech stack given the product requirements <br/>
    ▪ Tinker with a proof-of-concept prototype to better guesstimate the cost and development timeline of the project <br/>
    ▪ Implement the MVP's core functionality in the prototype: video conferencing, chat and in-window shared document editing
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Researched potential tech stacks that could meet the product’s business requirements and proposed AWS Chime as the best option due to its comprehensiveness of features, scalability, and reliability<br/>
    ▪ Built the prototype with AWS Chime SDK (React library). The image above is us having one of our meetings on it
    </div>
    
<h4>Reflections</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Self-Understanding: I have a smaller risk appetite than I initially thought. 
    Startups have always fascinated the business-side of me because of their exciting journeys of extreme highs and lows. 
    I have always been open to founding a startup because there are so many interesting ideas and because I have had 
    quite a bit of an intrapreneurial streak in me. 
    But through this experience, I realise I don't like to actually be in the situation
    of a founder myself as the high uncertainty invokes a fair amount of anxiety. I suppose my risk appetite and 
    personality will continue to evolve but as of now, a founder role might not quite be for me.
