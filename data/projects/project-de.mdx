<h4>Summary</h4>
I attempted to co-found (as a technical 
co-founder) an EdTech startup with two NTU lecturers, 
a NUS administrator and an external financier

<h4>Description</h4>
▪ I built a simple website (largely templated) with AWS as 
a technical proof-of-concept of the product features we 
envisioned. The image above is us having one of our 
meetings on my prototype<br/>
▪ The main features are video conferencing, chat and in-window 
shared document editing<br/>
▪ The project fell through due to differing long-term 
visions for the company<br/>
