<h4>Summary</h4>
I attempted to co-found (as a technical 
co-founder) an EdTech startup with two NTU lecturers, 
a NUS administrator and an external financier

<h4>Description</h4>
▪ I built a simple website (largely templated) with AWS as 
a technical proof-of-concept of the product features we 
envisioned to be built. The image above is us having one of our 
meetings on the website I built<br/>
▪ The main features are video conferencing, chat and in-window 
shared document editing<br/>
▪ The project dissolved over disagreements about the long-term 
vision of the company<br/>
▪ I had also persuaded two of my peers to join the technical team
