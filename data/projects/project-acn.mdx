<h4>Summary</h4>
I did some programming to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the ETL process.

<h4>Description</h4>
▪ I refactored various portions of code in CloverDX to reduce the amount of 
post-CloverDX manual transformation that was needed for 
several hundred thousand records
▪ I wrote a command line script to automatically log in to WinSCP, 
extract data to local storage, and decrypt files. This was previously 
done manually
▪ Both my mini-projects were validated, approved, used, and will 
continue to be used for the next phase of the project
