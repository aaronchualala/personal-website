<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    Increased the efficiency and accuracy of data Extraction and Transformation processes
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    The data pipeline at my internship, which involved the migration of data from legacy IT systems to a new cloud system, involved 
    several tedious, repetitive steps. I automated these steps with Windows Command Line and CloverDX scripting.
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    Tedious and repetitive steps in the pipeline process take time away from higher-value-add activities like engaging with 
    stakeholders or planning of migration sequences. However, the current business analysts were unfamiliar with the scripting 
    language and environment.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Leverage my technical knowledge to create scripts <br/>
    ▪ Abstract my solution into a simple interface so colleagues can continue using my script after my departure
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Refactored code in CloverDX to reduce the amount of post-CloverDX manual transformation that was needed for several hundred thousand records<br/>
    ▪ Wrote Command Line scripts to auto-login to WinSCP, auto-extract data to local storage, and auto-decrypt files.<br/>
    ▪ Scripts were test validated, approved by supervisor and used in production
