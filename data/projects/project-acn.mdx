<h4>Summary</h4>
I used command-line and CloverDX scripting to increase the efficiency and accuracy of 
data Extraction and Transformation processes in my Business Analyst role at Accenture.

<h4>Description</h4>
▪ I refactored code in CloverDX to reduce the amount of 
post-CloverDX manual transformation that was needed for 
several hundred thousand records<br/>
▪ I wrote command line scripts to automatically log in to WinSCP, 
extract data to local storage, and decrypt files. This was previously 
done manually<br/>
▪ Both my projects were validated, approved and used in production
