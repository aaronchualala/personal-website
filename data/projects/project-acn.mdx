<h4>Summary</h4>
    <div>
    I increased the efficiency and accuracy of data Extraction and Transformation processes done by my team at Accenture
    </div>

<h4>Context</h4>
    <div>
    The data pipeline of the project I was assigned to at Accenture, which involved the migration of data from legacy IT systems to a new cloud system, involved several tedious, repetitive steps. I automated these steps with Windows Command Line and CloverDX scripting.
    </div>

<h4>Problem</h4>
    <div>
    Tedious and repetitive steps in the pipeline process take time away from higher-value-add activities like engaging with stakeholders or planning of migration sequences. However, the current business analysts did not have the bandwidth to invest in improving these technical processes.
    </div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Leverage my technical knowledge to create scripts <br/>
    ▪ Abstract my solution into a simple interface so colleagues can continue using my script after my departure
    </div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Refactored code in CloverDX to reduce the amount of post-CloverDX manual transformation that was needed for several hundred thousand records<br/>
    ▪ Wrote Command Line scripts to auto-login to WinSCP, auto-extract data to local storage, and auto-decrypt files.<br/>
    ▪ Scripts were test validated, approved by supervisor and used in production
    </div>
    
<h4>Reflections</h4>
    <div>
    ▪ Scaling power — my project was relatively small and simple compared to other projects I did. However, successfully deploying it in this large project that Accenture was doing meant my small improvements were multiplied across our many data files. Miniscule improvements in big established projects can be far more impactful than massive changes in small fast-changing projects. <br/>
    ▪ Curiosity — trying to understand the tools that I was using at a deeper level enabled me to discover their more obscure APIs and features which led me to start on this project
